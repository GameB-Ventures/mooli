## Goal

Allow users to easily create smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. 

### Details


Audience:
... (think)

### Stages

### To Do

- [x] Pick one generic use case where smart contract can be generated for any of the audience above
- [ ] Derive one specific use-case from generic (also solves audience)
- [ ] Map use case into a decision tree of branches and input params

### Generic Use case

Generic use-case example: 
- A and B wants to enter an agreement.
- B will get paid 'x' amount if condition 'c' is met

What kind of conditions?
..

A contract can be self-executing or may require human intervention.

Human intervention / Decision delegation can be configured to A / B (based on initial agreement)
or
new intermediate parties can be invited:
P... P(n)

Only binary contracts for now, where at the end of expiry the condition (C) is either true / false. A term for a contract can be infinity.
